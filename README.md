# SQL Prep Test

Welcome to the SQL Prep Test! This is a hands-on resource built to help you practice and master SQL skills commonly evaluated in technical interviews. This test was developed based on direct feedback from employers across tech, finance, and data-driven industries, ensuring you're learning what's most relevant to real-world hiring expectations.

Whether you're brushing up before an interview, building a portfolio, or strengthening your resume, this project is designed to give you the confidence and fluency needed to succeed.

## What You'll Cover
This test covers a range of SQL concepts, gradually increasing in complexity:

### Core SQL Concepts
- SELECT, FROM, and WHERE clauses
- ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and HAVING
- Filtering and sorting data
- Table aliasing

### Intermediate to Advanced Techniques
- JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL)
- Aggregation with functions like COUNT(), SUM(), AVG(), etc.
- CASE statements for conditional logic
- Creating and querying VIEWS
- Subqueries and nested SELECTs

Each section includes practical exercises that mimic the style and difficulty of real interview questions, allowing you to apply your knowledge immediately.

## Why This Matters
SQL is a foundational skill for roles in data analytics, business intelligence, and backend development. Listing SQL on your resume means you're ready to:
- Answer technical questions with confidence in interviews
- Interpret and manipulate real-world data
- Solve practical business problems using structured queries

This prep test not only reinforces your syntax knowledge but helps you think like an analyst—applying logic to clean, join, and extract insights from data.

## whats what in the files

- `db_builder.py` - This file sets up the data for you just run it

- `final.ipynb` - This is the notebook you will work in to do all the queries. 


## To run this project
- Fork the repo 
- Make a Virtual Environment 
- Run the `db_builder.py file 
- Then start with the `final.ipynb` 
- The code cells all have triple quotes and your query here. Just remove "your query here" and put yours in. 
```python
select_query = """
YOUR QUERY HERE
"""
```

## Virtual Environment Commands
