        "\n",
        "A `view` is a virtual table in a database, created by writing a query that selects data from one or more underlying tables. Unlike regular tables, views do not store data themselves but instead dynamically display results from the underlying data when queried. You can think of a view as a saved SQL query that can be reused just like a table.\n",
        "\n",
        "When you create a `view`, it’s like taking a snapshot of a specific query, which can then be referenced by name, making it easier to work with complex queries or repeated data needs.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why Use Views?\n",
        "\n",
        "- Simplification of Complex Queries: Views help simplify complex queries by allowing you to store the query logic. Instead of writing a long query repeatedly, you can reference the view, which saves time and reduces errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For example, our report card query is long and uses a a lot of logic. We would use it often so it would be a great use case.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Security: Views can provide an additional layer of security. By restricting access to certain columns or rows in a table, views allow you to expose only the data a user needs to see.\n",
        "\n",
        "  - For example, you might create a view that hides sensitive data, such as emails or personal information, while still allowing access to essential details like grades or attendance.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Consistency: Views ensure that any repetitive business logic or complex calculations are performed consistently every time. This eliminates the risk of inconsistencies if different users write queries differently to access the same information.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Performance: In some cases, views can improve performance by predefining complex joins or calculations. This can make querying faster, especially for commonly used queries."
